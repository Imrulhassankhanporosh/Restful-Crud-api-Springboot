# Restful-Crud-api-Springboot
This is REST API with Spring Boot project- Java, MySQL, Springboot, JPA, & Maven

In this project, we create REST APIs using Spring Boot from the beginning. Here we will first create a simple Spring Boot Application using Spring Initializer 
and after that will write code for to make it work as Spring Boot REST API. Finally, REST API testing with Postman tool will be demonstrated. Here Create, Read, 
Update and Delete - All 4 REST API CRUD operations are implemented in this session with the help of Spring Boot. This will be a Simple Spring Boot REST API 
application which will support CRUD operations. All the CRUD operations will be tested with the help of Postman tool.

# Some Key points for REST API - 
  1. REST APIs also called as RESTful APIs
  2.REST = Representational State Transfer 
  3. API = Application Programming Interface
  4. REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways
  5. A REST API is an application programming interface that follows the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services
  6. REST APIs work over HTTP
  7. Delivers information using any one of the following formats - 
  8. JSON (Most popular) ,  Text , HTML , XML , Javascript and more 
 
# Spring Boot Key points -
  1. Easily create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications
  2. Tomcat, Jetty are embedded
  3. Provides starter dependencies
  4. Automatically configure Spring and third party libraries
  5. Provides production ready features such as health checks, metrics, etc.
  6. No code generation, No XML configuration
